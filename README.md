Using opencv and possibly input redirection with luma for automated shiny hunting

Update 2/27/2023: With the eshop closing in a couple weeks, I'm going to revisit this now that it's on my mind again. Apparently HzMod can stream VC games. I have a vesion of this on my PC that can detect quickly and has inputs to automate catching. I'll be repurposing it so I can stream from my DS, to my PC, and redirect my PC inputs to the DS.
